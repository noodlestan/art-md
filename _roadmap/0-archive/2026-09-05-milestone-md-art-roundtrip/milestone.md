# Milestone: MD Art Roundtrip

**ID:** `md-art-roundtrip`

**Status:** `DONE`

## Summary

Singularize the accidental `@art-js/artificials-*` plural package names (phase 0), migrate poc-parse into proper packages, migrate the testing fixtures, verify lossless roundtrip (parse `.art` → serialize back → zero diffs), refine whitespace handling (pure-whitespace gaps preserved), archive poc-parse, and publish v0.0.1. Each commit guarantees no source change breaks the roundtrip contract.

Phases 0–7 are complete. Phases 8–11 (gap closure, refactoring, archive/publish, knowledge integration) were split out into the **Consolidate** milestone (`_roadmap/4-now/milestone-consolidate/milestone.md`), which carries the refactor, cleanup, documentation, and v0.0.2 publish scope forward.

## Source Tasks

- `_backlog/_architect.md` — Architecture Briefing: Artificial
- `_backlog/0-archive/2026-08-15-lan-poc-parse/plan.md` — archived POC plan: learnings, findings, feedback; `attachments/_architect.md` + `attachments/_parking-lot.md` (POC briefing and WIP)

## Phase Plans

Phases 8–11 were split into the **Consolidate** milestone (`_roadmap/4-now/milestone-consolidate/milestone.md`): gap closure, refactoring and test coverage, archive and publish, and knowledge integration.

**Next step:** Milestone complete. Remaining work continues under the **Consolidate** milestone (`_roadmap/4-now/milestone-consolidate/milestone.md`).

## Commit Conventions

All the plans generated from this milestone uses the following commit convention: `{type}(md-art-rountrip): {message}`. Where types are one of `plan`, `build`, `refactor`, `integrate`, `publish`.

Examples:

```
plan(md-art-roundtrip): plan `migrate-and-verify` ready for building
build(md-art-roundtrip): verify parser output against POC snapshots
integrate(md-art-roundtrip): complete parser migration and advance milestone
```

## Findings (from archived POC plan)

Integrated from `_backlog/0-archive/plan-poc-parse/` (plan.md, `attachments/_architect.md`, `attachments/_parking-lot.md`).

**Roundtrip fixture strategy** (from the archived POC briefing, MD Art Roundtrip milestone): use incrementally complex fixtures to generate and check-in a validated `art-ast.json` file with a parser test, then generate back and compare the md with a serializer test.

**POC split design** (from the archived POC briefing): the POC was internally partitioned along the pipeline boundaries to mirror the future `art-js` modules — `libs/primitives` (types, type assertions), `libs/parser` (md → mdast → artast), `libs/serializer` (artast → mdast → md). The serializer is missing from the package plan above and is required for the roundtrip (phase 5).

## Decisions (from archived POC parking lot)

Answered during planning; recorded as decisions, no longer open questions:

- Pure-whitespace gap `NaturalBlock`s (`type: "text"`, `value: "\n\n"`): **preserve** — no filtering. Logic that affects JSON output only changes after the verified migration (after phase 3); gap handling is refined reactively in phase 8.
- `createNestedContext` injection in handler factories: **eliminate** during migration — do not carry it into `@art-js/artificial-parser`.
- Dead `fieldBlockFactory` export: **not kept** — likely introduced later if needed.
- Fixture snapshot diffing (the runner only asserts parse success; one input lacks a snapshot): handled in phase 5 (implement serializer) — fixture tests become two-way (`source.md → art.json` and `art.json → parsed.md`, diffing `source.md` against `parsed.md`, counted as overhead).

## Documentation to produce

(WIP)

- `art-js/architecture/index.md` - artificial ecosystem core
- `art-js/architecture/components.md` - major components of the ecosystem (as opposed to layers)
- `art-js/architecture/lib/index.md` - libs: responsibilities, dependencies, build system, distribution, test strategy
- `art-js/architecture/cli/index.md` - clis: packages, responsibilities, dependencies, build system, distribution, test strategy
- move some ADRs from root `architecture/` to `art-js/libs/parser/`
- i.e. create `art-js/libs/parser/architecture` with index placeholder and some ADRs from root
- `architecture/` (index the other architecture indexes)

## Follow ups

- Reactive core (chokidar → signals → memo recompute)
- Template engine research (Nunjucks/Handlebars/Liquid vs `.tart` requirements)
- Precompiled rewrite (install-time compilation + per-project overrides)
- Standalone build of the compile command — `bin/compile`, `architecture/records/adr/compile.art`-backed (follow-up from the archived POC plan)
