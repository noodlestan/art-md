# Milestone: Consolidate

**ID:** `consolidate`

**Status:** `WORKING`

**Template:** `.agents/domains/roadmaps/templates/milestone.tart`

**Skill:** `write-milestone`

**Purpose:** Refactor, cleanup, and document the constructs, parser, and serializer packages, then publish v0.0.2 of these.

**Description:** Consolidates the remaining (not-DONE) phases of the MD Art Roundtrip milestone — gap closure, refactoring and test coverage, archive and publish, and knowledge integration — into a single coherent milestone focused on hardening and documenting the `@art-js/artificial-*` packages and releasing v0.0.2.

## Summary

Carry forward the unfinished work split out of the MD Art Roundtrip milestone: close the roundtrip gaps surfaced by the pipeline suite, refactor and harden the parser/serializer/constructs code, archive the POC, integrate learnings back into briefings and guides, and publish v0.0.2 of the constructs, parser, and serializer packages. Each commit keeps the roundtrip contract intact.

## Source Tasks

- Milestone (archived): `_roadmap/1-done/milestone-md-art-roundtrip/milestone.md` — phases 8–11 split out into this milestone.
- Briefing: `_backlog/_architect.md` — approach (POC-first, schema-first in TS, mdast substrate) and milestone sequence.
- Parking Lot: `_backlog/_parking-lot.md` — pending items relevant to roundtrip gaps and constructs.

## Phases

| Index | Name                              | Status    |
| ----- | --------------------------------- | --------- |
| #1    | Integrate feedback and follow-ups | `DONE`    |
| #2    | Maintenance                       | `WORKING` |

### Phase: 1 — Integrate feedback, Refactoring and Test Coverage

**Goal:** Harden the migrated packages before archive and publish. Integrate feedback and follow-ups from completed plans, close the TagReference spec gap, and clean up noisy fixtures.

**Description:** Refactoring and test coverage across the migrated `@art-js/artificial-*` packages (parser, serializer, constructs, primitives), including the `tryPreProcessors`/`maybeHandleFactory` merge, `createNestedContext` rename/refactor, and unscoped constants cleanup. Scan completed plans for feedback and follow-ups, introduce TagReference spec, simplify tag definitions by removing projections prose, and remove noisy `_` fixture files.

**Status:** `DONE`

**Dependencies:** None.

### Phase: 2 — Maintenance

**Goal:** Archive poc-parse and publish v0.0.2 of constructs, parser, and serializer and learnings back into briefings, guides, architecture docs, and records.

**Description:** After publish, integrate the knowledge and learnings from milestone execution back into briefings, guides, architecture docs, and records, closing the consolidation.

**Status:** `WORKING`

**Dependencies:** None.

## Work

### Next

Execute `plan-archive-poc-and-publish` (`READY`).

### Blockers

None.

## Operating Instructions

### Setting Up

Run from the repository root (monorepo):

```bash
npm ci # to install dependencies.
```

### Verifying Completion

Runs automatically on pre-commit hook (from the repository root):

```bash
npm run ci # lint, test and build
```

### Verifying Step

When making changes to parser, serializer, or constructs packages, execute from `cli/pipeline-tests/`:

```bash
npm run test # runs test-parser and test-serializer against stable fixtures
```

## Follow ups

- Reactive core (chokidar → signals → memo recompute)
- Template engine research (Nunjucks/Handlebars/Liquid vs `.tart` requirements)
- Precompiled rewrite (install-time compilation + per-project overrides)
- Standalone build of the compile command — `bin/compile`, `architecture/records/adr/compile.art`-backed
