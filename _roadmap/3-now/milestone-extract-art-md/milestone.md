# Milestone: Extract MD

**ID:** `extract-art-md`

**Status:** `PLANNING`

**Template:** `.agents/domains/roadmaps/templates/milestone.tart`

**Skill:** `write-milestone`

**Purpose:** Separate Art MD (the art language) and Art JS (libraries for extracting, validating, and projecting art) so that knowledge, roadmaps, and backlogs can have a more focused scope.

**Description:** Renames the current Art JS repository to Art MD, extracts all remaining placeholder packages into a new Art JS repository, and updates the Artificials umbrella project and the Noodlestan website to reflect the new repository layout.

## Path Variables

This section lists the path variables used throughout the Milestone file and its downstream work items. All file references in the Milestone and downstream work items MUST use these variables — never bare filesystem paths.

| Variable          | Resolved Path                                  | Purpose                              |

| `$PROJECT`        | `checkouts/art-js-planning`                    | Current checkout for planning only.  |
| `$ART_MD`         | `checkouts/art-md-building` (after rename)     | Repository: Art MD checkout.         |
| `$ART_JS`         | `checkouts/art-js-building` (to be re-created) | Repository: Art JS checkout.         |
| `$ARTIFICIALS`    | `checkouts/artificials`                        | Repository: Artificials checkout.    |

## Summary

Rename the current Art JS repository to Art MD, extract all remaining placeholder packages (libs and cli) into a new Art JS repository, and update the Artificials umbrella project and the Noodlestan website, so that Art MD hosts only the md core packages and Art JS hosts the tooling placeholders.

## Scope

This section describes the working scope coordinated by the Milestone.

Changes in 4 repositories: the current Art JS repo is renamed to Art MD; a new Art JS repo is created and scaffolded; the placeholder libs and cli packages move from Art MD to Art JS; the Artificials umbrella and the Noodlestan website are updated to reflect the new layout.

### (Scope) Repository: Artificials

**Record:** `$ARTIFICIALS/_records/repository.art`

**Role:** Repo for the umbrella project coordinating the art projects; needs consolidation to list Art MD and Art JS.

**Partial:**

- `owner` — Project: Artificials
- `remote` — `git@github.com:noodlestan/artificials.git`

**Changes:**

- Consolidate the list of owned projects and repositories to include Art MD and Art JS.

**Dependencies:**

- None.

### (Scope) Repository: Art MD

**Record:** `$WORKSPACE/_records/repositories/art-js.art` (to be renamed)

**Role:** Created by this milestone by renaming the existing Art JS repository; hosts the md core packages (parser, serializer, constructs, primitives, spec, pipeline-tests).

**Partial:**

- `owner` — Project: Art MD (renamed from Project: Art JS)
- `remote` — `git@github.com:noodlestan/art-md.git` (already updated)

**Changes:**

- Update records at `$ART_MD/_records` rename repository, remote, adapt purposes and descriptions to new scope.
- Update knowledge: README, `_guide.md`, `package.json` description.
- Remove the placeholder packages extracted to Art JS.

**Operations:**

- Rename the git remote and repository.

**Dependencies:**

- None.

### (Scope) Repository: Art JS

**Record:** To be created at `$WORKSPACE/_records/repositories/art-js.art`

**Role:** Created and scaffolded by this milestone; receives the extracted placeholder packages.

**Partial:**

- `remote` — `git@github.com:noodlestan/art-js.git` (new)

**Changes:**

- Create the repository and scaffold the project skeleton.
- Create the records at `$ART_JS/_records` (project, repository, namespace) with purposes and descriptions adapted to new scope.
- Update knowledge: README, `_guide.md`, `package.json` description.
- Receive the extracted placeholder packages from Art MD.

**Dependencies:**

- Repository: Art MD — rename must complete before extraction.

### (Scope) Repository: Noodlestan Web

**Record:** `$WORKSPACE/_records/repositories/noodlestan-web.art`

**Role:** Website to update to reflect the new repository layout.

**Partial:**

- `owner` — Project: Noodlestan Web
- `remote` — `git@github.com:noodlestan/noodlestan-web.git`

**Changes:**

- Update website content referencing the Art JS / Art MD repositories.

**Dependencies:**

- Repository: Art JS — extraction must complete before the website update.

## Execution Context

Execution occurs from `$WORKSPACE/`; the rename happens in `ART_MD` (checkout `checkouts/art-js-building`), the new Art JS repository is created as a new checkout, and the Artificials and Noodlestan Web checkouts are updated in their own repositories.

## Work

### Next

Plan the repository rename to Art MD (Phase 1).

### Blockers

None.

---

## Operating Instructions

### Setting Up

Run from the repository root (monorepo):

```bash
npm ci # to install dependencies.
```

Run from the workspace root:

```bash
npm ci # to install workspace dependencies.
npm run art-work clone {repo.name} # to create a new checkout of a known repository.
npm run art-work branch {branch.name} {checkout.location} # to create a working branch.
```

### Verifying Completion

Runs automatically on pre-commit hook (from the repository root):

```bash
npm run ci # lint, test and build
```

### Verifying Step

When making changes to parser, serializer, or constructs packages, execute from `cli/pipeline-tests/`:

```bash
npm run test # runs test-parser and test-serializer against stable fixtures
```

---

## Coordination

### Not In Scope

- **Implementing placeholder packages** — the extracted packages move as scaffolds; implementation is future work in Art JS.
- **Extracting the md core packages** — parser, serializer, constructs, primitives, spec, and pipeline-tests stay in Art MD.

### Evidence

- None yet.

### Findings

- **Placeholder packages** — bundler, program, validator, bin, dev-server, language-server, tools, and watcher are scaffolds (dist, LICENSE, README only) with no real code.
- **Md core packages** — parser, serializer, constructs, primitives, and pipeline-tests carry the real code and dependencies.

### Decisions

- **Extract all placeholders** — all remaining placeholder packages move to the new Art JS repo; Art MD keeps the md core.
- **Rename first** — the current repo is renamed to Art MD before extraction begins.
- **Repository vs Project** — the repository is the physical thing (purpose: to host and manage packages and planning artefacts); the project is the product (purpose: to serve its customers). Purpose states what something is for; description states what it is made of.

### Knowledge to Update

- Included in the plans.

### Follow Ups

- Update checkout records after the rename and extraction.

### Feedback

No sub-agent reports yet.
