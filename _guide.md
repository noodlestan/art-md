# Guide: Art MD

> Host and manage the Art MD packages and tools, and their knowledge and planning artefacts.

Monorepo containing the Art MD roadmap and backlogs, language spec, architecture knowledge, and library source code.

Uses Workflow: Planning Work with one backlog per package, coordinating with Workflow: Roadmapping from one project-wide roadmap.

## Recommended Reading

Agents SHOULD scan these files for relevant clarifications when faced with ambiguity or omissions that may result from missing definitions.

- `_guide.md` — this file: system overview, layout, setup, verification.
- `_records/project.art` — the project record.
- `_records/repository.art` — the repository record.

## Repository Layout

```
_guide.md           — this file
_backlog/           — plans, instructions, reports
_records/           — project, repository, namespace, and license records
_roadmap/           — project roadmap and architect briefing
architecture/       — repository-level architecture documentation
cli/                — CLI packages
libs/               — library packages
spec/               — the artificial language specification
```

| -------------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| Art MD (root)  | `_guide.md`                 | `_backlog/` |
| Bin            | `cli/bin/_guide.md`         | `NONE`      |

## Records Management

Records are co-located with the resources they describe in `_records/` directories:

- **Project:** `_records/project.art`
- **Repository:** `_records/repository.art`
- **Namespace:** `_records/namespace.art`
- **License:** `_records/license.art`

This repository maintains architecture references at:

- `architecture/index.md` — repository-level architecture index.
- `architecture/principles.md` — design principles.
- `architecture/components.md` — components and relationships.
- `architecture/art-md-fixture-tests.md` — fixture test suite.

## Workflows

Projects in this repository use the following workflows:

| Workflow / Path                                                            | Purpose                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning Work** `$DOMAINS/work/workflows/planning-work/workflow.art`     | Create and manage work item lifecycles, collecting operational instructions according to context. |
| **Delegating Work** `$DOMAINS/work/workflows/delegating-work/workflow.art` | Organize work delegation to sub-agents with validation, execution, and verification.              |
| **Executing Work** `$DOMAINS/work/workflows/executing-work/workflow.art`   | Organize work execution by sub-agents to produce completed, verified outcomes and feedback.       |
| **Deploying** `$DOMAINS/deployments/workflows/deploying/workflow.art`      | Organizes deployment of artefacts in operations.                                                  |

### Planning Work

- The backlog lives at `_backlog/` with subdirectories such as `/3-now` and `/4-next/`.
- The short-term focus is captured in `_backlog/_parking-lot.md`.
- The requirements, use cases, and principles are captured in `_backlog/_architect.md`.

## Operating Instructions

### Operating Instructions: Setting Up

**Instructions:**

Run from the repository root (monorepo):

```bash
npm ci # to install dependencies.
```

### Operating Instructions: Verifying Completion

**Instructions:**

Runs automatically on pre-commit hook (from the repository root):

```bash
npm run ci # lint, test and build
```

### Operating Instructions: Verifying Step

**Instructions:**

When making changes to parser, serializer, or constructs packages, execute from `cli/codec-tests/`:

```bash
npm run test # runs test-parser and test-serializer against stable fixtures
```

To learn how to debug failed tests, read `./architecture/art-md-fixture-tests.md`.
