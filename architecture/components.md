# Art JS Components

The Art JS ecosystem is a modular pipeline for parsing and serialising a markdown dialect (Art-MD). Components are organised into core libraries (`libs/`) and CLI tools (`cli/`).

## Core Libraries

### Primitives (`@art-js/primitives`)

Provides the base types and utilities the ecosystem is built on: the document contract (`ArtDocument`, `ConstructBase`, `ContainerConstructBase`), the mdast and position types (`MdastNode`, `Point`, `Position`), and the parser visit context (`ParserVisitContext`, `ParserSource`) with its helpers (`nodePosition`, `sectionDepth`). No internal dependencies — all other libs consume it.

### Constructs (`@art-js/constructs`)

The contract layer of the ecosystem: it binds the parser and serializer. It owns the factory functions, the parser/serializer interfaces, and the data shapes. The package is split into three slices — factories, parsers, serializers. Ships both the contract types and the concrete implementations.

- Contract types: `ConstructProcessor` (`captureNode`), `ConstructIntegrator` (`integrate`), `ConstructParser`, `ConstructParserFactory`; `ConstructSerializer` (`toMdast`), `ConstructSerializerFactory`
- Data shapes: `Construct`, `BlockContent`, `InlineContent` (built on the primitives base types)
- Open registry: `BlockConstructMap`, `InlineConstructMap` (augmented via declaration merging)
- Concrete constructs: `FieldBlock`, `FieldInline`, `SectionBlock`, `Tag`, `NaturalBlock`, `NaturalExpression`

### Parser (`@art-js/parser`)

Transforms markdown into an `ArtDocument` via a generic dispatch loop. Construct-agnostic — knows only the contract types, never names a concrete construct. The [ecosystem overview](overview.md#the-parse-direction) describes how processors and the default construct interact.

- Entry point: `parse(markdown)`
- Config: `ParserConfig` with `defaultConstruct` and `constructs` list
- Dispatch: processors in order → `NaturalBlock` fallback
- Context: `ParserVisitContext` stack for nested constructs

### Serializer (`@art-js/serializer`)

Transforms an `ArtDocument` back into markdown. Builds a registry from config factories, visits the construct tree bottom-up, and dispatches to `toMdast` implementations. Construct-agnostic — the [ecosystem overview](overview.md#the-serialise-direction) explains the composition decision.

- Entry point: `serialize(document)`
- Config: `SerializerConfig` with `constructs` factory list
- Registry: `Map<string, ConstructSerializer>` keyed by construct name
- Sibling placement: block constructs (`SectionBlock`, `FieldBlock`) emit children as siblings

### Validator (`@art-js/validator`)

Checks parsed modules against structural and semantic rules — required fields, valid construct nesting, naming conventions. Sits between parsing and execution.

### Program (`@art-js/program`)

Executes parsed and validated Art modules. Manages program state, resolves cross-module references, drives the execution model.

### Bundler (`@art-js/bundler`)

Resolves module dependencies, applies bundling rules, produces distributable artifacts. Consumes parser and validator output.

## CLI Surface

### Bin (`@art-js/bin`)

Primary CLI entry point. Exposes parse, serialize, validate, bundle, and run commands.

### Pipeline Tests (`@art-js/pipeline-tests`)

Fixture-based test suite for the parser and serializer roundtrip. See [art-md-fixture-tests.md](art-md-fixture-tests.md) for fixture anatomy.

### Dev Server (`@art-js/dev-server`)

Local development server with live-reload for interactive Art module testing. (Scaffolded.)

### Watcher (`@art-js/watcher`)

File system watcher that triggers rebuilds on source changes. Powers the dev experience. (Scaffolded.)

### Language Server (`@art-js/language-server`)

LSP server for Art and context files (work in progress). Will provide go-to-definition, diagnostics, completions. (Scaffolded.)

### Tools (`@art-js/tools`)

Deterministic utility operations for agents working with Art and context files. (Scaffolded.)

## Spec (`@art-js/spec`)

The Art language specification, written in Art itself. Consumed by parser, validator, and bundler. Both documentation and test data.

### `@art-js/poc-parse`

This package was used to prototype different options for the parser. The POC parser logic has been superseded by the `@art-js/parser`, `@art-js/constructs`, and `@art-js/serializer` packages. Last version of the POC can be found on [Github noodlestan/art-js](https://github.com/noodlestan/art-js/tree/e2940760f1b3fe8811b49d8dd724b82d1e668514/cli/poc-parse).
