# Instructions: `update-knowledge-and-guide`

**Plan:** `migrate-tests-pipeline`

**Iteration Id:** `update-knowledge-and-guide`

## Before you Start

::switch `agent-worker` — switch to the agent-worker agent mode to execute these instructions. Your mode must be `worker` before you start changing files.

These are your instructions.

- RULE: If at any point you are instructed to **REPORT A BLOCKER** or you encounter a commit with `policy` set to `MANUAL` execute the instruction in the "## How to Report Back to the Delegator" section below and STOP processing any other instructions.

## How to Report Back to the Delegator

1. Summarise the current context, asking: are you reporting completion or a BLOCKER?
2. Gather the evidence of changes made and outcomes achieved, or the blocker error details.
3. Use the `render-template` skill with the `.agents/domains/plans/templates/instructions-report.tart` to render your report and write it next to this instruction file: `plan-migrate-tests-pipeline/instructions/update-knowledge-and-guide__report.md`. No separate delegation record is created.
4. If your prompt included a `DIRECTIVE FEEDBACK:` include the feedback sections in the rendered report.
5. Generate the response and send it back to the delegator.
6. Keep the response terse per the Working Agreements: happy face + up to 3 bullet points (done `update-knowledge-and-guide`, created `{artefacts}`, thumbs up). The full trail lives in the report file; never repeat it in chat.

## Path Variables

| Variable            | Resolved Path                  | Purpose                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `$PROJECT`          | `$WORKSPACE/checkouts/art-js`  | project repository root   |
| `$PACKAGE_PIPELINE` | `$PROJECT/cli/pipeline-tests/` | pipeline test CLI package |

## Working Agreements

The plan workflow (see the entry point guide → Planning Workflow → Working Together) runs on three working agreements:

1. **This instructions file is self-contained.** Everything you need is in this file plus its mandatory reading — never rely on session memory, chat context, or details relayed by the user.
2. **Your report is mandatory.** The rendered report file carries the full trail: evidence, changes, verification results, blockers, feedback. Your chat response is only a pointer to it.
3. **User interaction is minimal.** The user relays this instructions file to the delegator and expects a light confirmation: a happy face and up to 3 bullet points — done `update-knowledge-and-guide`, created `{artefacts}`, thumbs up. If something goes horribly wrong, report the blocker instead of a summary.

## Goals

Update the repository guide and knowledge references to reflect the migrated test pipeline, replace the stale "Verifying Commit" operating instruction with a "Verifying Step", and remove all remaining poc-parse references.

## Mandatory Reading

- `$PROJECT/_guide.md` — repository guide to update (layout, projects, knowledge, operating instructions).

- RULE: You MUST follow any links under `## Mandatory Reading` sections found in the listed files.
- RULE: If you are unable to read a file linked under `## Mandatory Reading` you must stop and REPORT A BLOCKER.

## Operating Instructions

### Verifying Step

**Instructions:**

When making changes to parser, serializer, or constructs packages, execute from `cli/pipeline-tests/`:

```bash
npm run test # runs test-parser and test-serializer against stable fixtures
```

To learn how to debug failed tests, read `./architecture/art-md-fixture-tests.md`.

---

## Changes

- Step 1 / 2 — Update `_guide.md` verifying step and remove stale references
- Step 2 / 2 — Commit `update-knowledge-and-guide`

## Steps

### Step `1 / 2` — Update `_guide.md` verifying step and remove stale references

In `$PROJECT/_guide.md`:

- Replace the current `Operating Instructions: Verifying Commit` block (which is noise) with `Operating Instructions: Verifying Step`, containing:

  When making changes to parser, serializer, or constructs packages, execute from `cli/pipeline-tests/`:

  ```bash
  npm run test # runs test-parser and test-serializer against stable fixtures
  ```

  To learn how to debug failed tests, read `./architecture/art-md-fixture-tests.md`.

- Ensure the `## Repository Layout` includes `architecture/` (added in scaffold iteration).
- Ensure the `## Projects` section includes the `pipeline` entry (added in scaffold iteration).
- Ensure the knowledge references include repo architecture.
- Remove any remaining references to `poc-parse` or stale fixture paths throughout `_guide.md` and any knowledge files.

---

#### Commit: `update-knowledge-and-guide`

**Policy:** AUTONOMOUS — Agent should commit autonomously, push, and proceed to the next step.

**Message:**

```
docs(art-md-roundtrip): Update knowledge and guide.
```

---

## Final Verification

**Instructions:**

- Verify that commits have been executed and pushed (or not pushed) according to the commit's policy.
- Verify `_guide.md` has the `Verifying Step` operating instruction referencing `cli/pipeline-tests/` and `npm run test`.
- Verify no remaining `poc-parse` references exist.
- Execute the **Verifying Step** as defined in the "Operating Instructions" section.
- Report according to the "How to Report Back to the Delegator" instructions.
