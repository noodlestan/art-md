# Plan: Test Coverage

**Id:** `test-coverage`

**Status:** `DONE`

**Template:** `.agents/domains/plans/templates/plan.tart`

**Skill:** `write-plan`

**Purpose:** Add full coverage with unit tests to the parser, primitives, serializer, and constructs packages.

**Description:** Add unit tests and test helpers to all 4 packages, and elevate the vitest coverage thresholds.

## Mandatory Reading

::READ `$DOMAINS/plans/structures/plan.art` (Structure) — Describe the work-item changes through a series of iterations and commits with detailed instructions.

::READ `$DOMAINS/plans/structures/iteration.art` (Structure) — Define the iteration container for planned changes.

## Path Variables

| Variable     | Resolved Path             | Purpose                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `$WORKSPACE` | Current working directory | Workspace root directory             |
| `$PROJECT`   | Provided with prompt      | Repository root for all code changes |

## Summary

The 4 packages currently have partial unit test coverage: 7 test files total (6 in constructs, 1 in serializer) and none in parser or primitives. Build coverage incrementally — measure against the targets but do not attempt to reach them on the first steps; each step adds more tests. First establish a minimal baseline (happy path + most obvious exception path, all dependencies mocked in-file), then extract consistent test helpers colocated in each package (`src/test/helpers/{topic}/`), deepen coverage with more cases, align tests to a common setup/lock => execute => assert pattern, reduce repetition by consuming and abstracting helpers, close the remaining coverage gaps against the targets (lines 95, functions 100, branches 95, statements 95), and finally elevate the vitest thresholds in all 4 packages.

### Iteration: Add Minimal Unit Tests

**Id:** `add-minimal-unit-tests`

**Status:** `DONE`

**Purpose:** Establish a minimal unit test baseline across all 4 packages — happy path plus the most obvious exception path where one exists — with all dependencies mocked in-file.

**Description:** Add minimal unit tests for every module in `src/` (excluding `src/index.ts`) in parser, primitives, serializer, and constructs. Each test file mocks all dependencies in-file to isolate the module under test. Do not chase the coverage targets yet — measure and record the current coverage per package as the baseline.

**Instructions:** `./plan-test-coverage/instructions/add-minimal-unit-tests.md`

**Report:** `./plan-test-coverage/instructions/add-minimal-unit-tests__report.md`

**Changes:**

- parser: minimal tests for `builder.ts`, `mdast/isBlockType.ts`, `mdast/constants.ts`, `private/createDocumentContext.ts`, `config/createDefaultConfig.ts`, `config/types.ts`.
- primitives: minimal tests for `point.ts`, `constructs.ts`, `parser/helpers/nodePosition.ts`, `parser/helpers/createParserVisitContext.ts`, `parser/helpers/sectionDepth.ts`.
- serializer: minimal tests for `serializer.ts`, `artAstToMdast.ts`, `config/createDefaultSerializerConfig.ts`, `config/types.ts` (extend the existing `serializer.test.ts` where needed).
- constructs: minimal tests for all construct factories, processors, integrators, node-based factories, and helpers (`extractTags`, `rawSlice`, etc.); keep and extend the 6 existing test files.
- All dependencies mocked in-file with whatever it takes to isolate the module under test from its dependencies.
- Measure and record coverage per package as the baseline; do NOT attempt to reach the targets yet.

**Dependencies:**

None.

##### Commit: `add-minimal-unit-tests`

**Repository:** Art JS

**Message:**

```
test: Add minimal unit test coverage to parser, primitives, serializer, constructs

```

### Iteration: Extract Test Helpers

**Id:** `extract-test-helpers`

**Status:** `WORKING`

**Purpose:** Abstract mocking and setup helpers into consistent, colocated helpers so tests stop wiring mocks locally.

**Description:** Extract the in-file mocks and setup from the minimal tests into `src/test/helpers/{topic}/` (e.g. `makeSomethingMock.ts`), colocated in the package of the thing they mock. Consume the helpers in the tests written in the previous iteration.

**Instructions:** `./plan-test-coverage/instructions/extract-test-helpers.md`

**Changes:**

- Create `src/test/helpers/{topic}/` per package with helper primitives (e.g. `makeSomethingMock.ts`, `makeContext.ts`).
- Hoist the helper primitives so helpers are colocated in the package of the thing they mock.
- Consume the helpers in all tests written in `add-minimal-unit-tests`, replacing in-file mocks.

**Dependencies:**

- Iteration: Add Minimal Unit Tests.

**Purpose:** Add more test cases using the existing helpers, covering more branches and exception paths, and extract more helpers when a pattern is found.

**Description:** Extend the minimal tests with additional cases — edge cases, branch variants, exception paths — using the helpers from the previous iteration. When a repeated pattern is found, extract a new helper following the same conventions.

**Instructions:** `./plan-test-coverage/instructions/deepen-test-coverage.md`

**Changes:**

- Add more cases to existing tests using existing helpers.
- Extract more helpers when a pattern is found (same conventions as `extract-test-helpers`).

**Instructions:** `./plan-test-coverage/instructions/align-test-patterns.md`

**Changes:**

- Review all tests for setup/lock => execute => assert patterns.
- Align setup steps, semantics, variable names, mock content, assertion order and detail across tests.

### Iteration: Elevate Coverage Thresholds

**Id:** `elevate-coverage-thresholds`

**Status:** `DONE`

**Purpose:** Elevate the vitest coverage thresholds in all 4 packages to the targets.

**Description:** Elevate coverage thresholds in `libs/parser/vitest.config.ts`, `libs/primitives/vitest.config.ts`, `libs/serializer/vitest.config.ts`, and `libs/constructs/vitest.config.ts` to lines 95, functions 100, branches 95, statements 95.

- `libs/parser/vitest.config.ts`, `libs/primitives/vitest.config.ts`, `libs/serializer/vitest.config.ts`: elevate thresholds to:

  lines: 95,
  functions: 100,

  statements: 95,
  ```

**Dependencies:**

```

## Work

### Next

Delegate the next `READY` instruction.

### Blockers

None.

## Coordination

### Not In Scope

- `libs/bundler`, `libs/program`, `libs/validator`.
- POC (`cli/poc-parse/`) — scheduled for archiving.
- Fixture-based pipeline tests (`cli/pipeline-tests/`).
- New features.

### Evidence

- Coverage reports per package meet the targets (lines 95, functions 100, branches 95, statements 95) after `close-coverage-gaps`.
- Thresholds elevated in all 4 vitest configs in `elevate-coverage-thresholds`; `npm run ci` passes.
- Lint clean.

### Decisions

- The 4 packages are parser, primitives, serializer, and constructs; the "4 vitest configs" are `libs/parser/vitest.config.ts`, `libs/primitives/vitest.config.ts`, `libs/serializer/vitest.config.ts`, and `libs/constructs/vitest.config.ts` (`libs/bundler`, `libs/program`, `libs/validator` are out of scope).
- Coverage is built incrementally: minimal baseline first, then helpers, then deepening, alignment, repetition reduction, gap closure, and finally threshold elevation — thresholds are only elevated once the targets are met.
- Test helpers live in `src/test/helpers/{topic}/` colocated in the package of the thing they mock (e.g. `makeSomethingMock.ts`).
- All dependencies are mocked (in-file or via helpers) to isolate each module under test.
- `src/index.ts` is excluded from coverage in all 4 packages (already the case in the vitest configs).

### Follow Ups

- Update the milestone `consolidate` Items table status for this plan as it progresses.
- Reconcile milestone `consolidate` Items table (stale plan paths/statuses).
