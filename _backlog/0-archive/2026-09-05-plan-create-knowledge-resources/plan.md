# Plan: Create Knowledge Resources

**Id:** `create-knowledge-resources`

**Status:** `DONE`

**Template:** `.agents/domains/plans/templates/plan.tart`

**Skill:** `write-plan`

**Purpose:** Seed the art-js repository architecture documentation: ecosystem overview, component index, lib and cli package overviews, and update knowledge references in the guide.

**Description:** Create `architecture/components.md` (major components), `architecture/lib/index.md` (libs: responsibilities, dependencies, build, distribution, test strategy), `architecture/cli/index.md` (clis: same). Update `architecture/index.md` to index the sub-indexes. Update `_guide.md` knowledge references. The existing `architecture/art-md-fixture-tests.md` and `architecture/art-md-roundtrip.md` (from the previous plan) remain as-is.

## Mandatory Reading

::READ `$DOMAINS/plans/structures/plan.art` (Structure) — Describe the work-item changes through a series of iterations and commits with detailed instructions.

::READ `$DOMAINS/plans/structures/iteration.art` (Structure) — Define the iteration container for planned changes.

## Path Variables

| Variable     | Resolved Path             | Purpose                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `$WORKSPACE` | Current working directory | Workspace root directory             |
| `$PROJECT`   | Provided with prompt      | Repository root for all code changes |
| `$ARCH`      | `$PROJECT/architecture/`  | Repo-level architecture directory    |

## Summary

Seed the art-js repository architecture documentation: ecosystem overview, component index, and knowledge references in the guide. Architecture documents convey knowledge beyond facts — interpretation, patterns, and decisions — written as prose grouped by role, not flat fact tables.

## Context

### Upstream Work

| Kind      | Path                                                     | Role                                                                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Milestone | `_backlog/3-now/milestone-md-art-roundtrip/milestone.md` | Defines this plan as phase 7; "Documentation to produce" section lists the architecture docs to seed. |
| Briefing  | `_backlog/_architect.md`                                 | Approach (POC-first, schema-first in TS, mdast substrate) and milestone sequence.                     |

### Knowledge

- ::READ `architecture/index.md` (Knowledge) — Current repo-level architecture index (already has fixture-tests and roundtrip).
- ::READ `libs/parser/architecture/parser.md` (Knowledge) — Parser design principles (layered architecture, context, detection patterns).
- ::READ `architecture/art-md-roundtrip.md` (Knowledge) — Roundtrip pipeline architecture.
- ::READ `architecture/art-md-fixture-tests.md` (Knowledge) — Roundtrip pipeline testing.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Iteration: Seed Architecture Index And Components Doc `./plan-create-knowledge-resources/instructions/seed-architecture-index-and-components.md` | `DONE` |
| Iteration: Write Ecosystem Overview `./plan-create-knowledge-resources/instructions/write-ecosystem-overview.md`                                 | `DONE` |
| Iteration: Update Knowledge References `./plan-create-knowledge-resources/instructions/consolidate-knowledge-references.md`                      | `DONE` |

### Iteration: Seed Architecture Index And Components Doc

**Id:** `seed-architecture-index-and-components`

**Status:** `DONE`

**Purpose:** Create the repo-level architecture components document and update the architecture index to list sub-indexes.

**Description:** Create `$ARCH/components.md` listing the major components of the art-js ecosystem (parser, serializer, constructs, primitives, bundler, program, validator, bin, pipeline-tests, dev-server, language-server, watcher, tools). Update `$ARCH/index.md` to add the components document and the two sub-indexes (lib, cli) as links.

**Instructions:** `./plan-create-knowledge-resources/instructions/seed-architecture-index-and-components.md`

**Report:** `./plan-create-knowledge-resources/instructions/seed-architecture-index-and-components__report.md`

**Changes:**

- Create `$ARCH/components.md` listing the major components of the art-js ecosystem.
- Update `$ARCH/index.md` to add components.md, lib/index.md, and cli/index.md as links.

**Dependencies:**

None.

**Message:**

```

### Iteration: Write Ecosystem Overview

**Id:** `write-ecosystem-overview`

**Status:** `DONE`

**Purpose:** Write the art-js ecosystem overview as prose, conveying knowledge beyond facts: how the packages fit together, their roles, patterns, and decisions — not a flat table of package metadata.

**Description:** Write `$ARCH/overview.md` (or fold into `$ARCH/index.md`) as prose, grouping packages by their role in the ecosystem rather than by cli/lib. No tables, no cli/lib separation. Each package is described by its role and how it participates in the ecosystem, in a sentence or two.

**Instructions:** `./plan-create-knowledge-resources/instructions/write-ecosystem-overview.md`

**Report:** `./plan-create-knowledge-resources/instructions/write-ecosystem-overview__report.md`

**Changes:**

- Write a prose ecosystem overview for `$ARCH`, grouping packages by role (supporting, roundtrip, planned) rather than cli/lib.
- No tables — use prose and grouped lists.

**Notes:**

- Architecture documents convey knowledge beyond facts: interpretation, patterns, and decisions. Do NOT produce flat fact tables of package metadata.
- No cli/lib separation — group by role in the ecosystem.
- Some `cli/` packages are only scaffolded (e.g. `dev-server`, `language-server`, `watcher`, `tools`). If a package's role is not obvious, list it under "Planned Packages" without speculative prose about what it may become.
- Example structure:

  ```md
  ## Supporting Packages

  - `@art-js/primitives` — {role}

  ## Md-Art-Md Roundtrip

  {description}

  - `@art-js/constructs` — {role}
  - `@art-js/parser` — {role}
  - `@art-js/serializer` — {role}

  ## Planned Packages

  - ...
  ```

**Dependencies:**

None.

```

### Iteration: Consolidate Knowledge References

**Id:** `consolidate-knowledge-references`

**Status:** `DONE`

**Purpose:** Update `_guide.md` knowledge references to include the new architecture documents. \_guide includes only indexes with terse description of what they index.

**Description:** Update `_guide.md` to add `architecture/lib/index.md` and `architecture/cli/index.md` to the knowledge references section.

**Instructions:** `./plan-create-knowledge-resources/instructions/consolidate-knowledge-references.md`

**Report:** `./plan-create-knowledge-resources/instructions/consolidate-knowledge-references__report.md`

**Changes:**

- Add architecture reference to libs/constructs
- Add architecture reference to libs/serializer
- Deduplicate Art JS vs libs knowledge
- Update `_guide.md` knowledge references to list architecture indexes.

**Dependencies:**

None.

- Update guide
```

## Work

### Next

All iterations complete. Plan DONE.

### Blockers

None.

## Coordination

### Not In Scope

- **ADR migration** — Already done (`libs/parser/architecture/` exists).
- **Detailed per-package architecture** — Deferred to future plans.

### Evidence

- `libs/parser/architecture/` exists with `index.md` and `parser.md`.
- `architecture/art-md-fixture-tests.md` and `architecture/art-md-roundtrip.md` exist (from previous plan).
- `architecture/components.md` created — prose describing major components and relationships.
- `architecture/overview.md` created — prose ecosystem overview grouped by role.
- `_guide.md` updated with new architecture document references.

### Decisions

- **Prose, not tables** — Architecture docs convey knowledge beyond facts; no flat fact tables.
- **Group by role, not cli/lib** — Packages are grouped by their ecosystem role (supporting, roundtrip, planned).
- **Three iterations** — Seed index + components, write ecosystem overview, update references. Each is a separate commit.

### Follow Ups

None.
