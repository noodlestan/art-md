## Layout

The `@art-md/constructs` package is split into three layers, each with its own `src/` folder and public surface:

```
src/
├── factories/     # construct record factories (createX from factory-data)
├── parser/        # construct parsers (processor + integrator hooks)
├── serializer/    # construct serializers (toMdast)
└── index.ts       # re-exports the three public surfaces
```

Each layer follows the same shape: one folder per construct under `constructs/`, shared helpers in sibling folders, a `types.ts` for the layer's contract, an internal `index.ts` barrel, and a `public.ts` exposing the layer's public surface (factory list, fallback, and entry points).
